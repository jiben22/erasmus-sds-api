('Cross-Cultural-Communication-ang','Cross Cultural Communication','The nature of today’s business-driven cultural interactions - face-to-face or distance - has led to a growing awareness on the part of multi-national firms for a need to better understand the unwritten communication rules and subtle societal norms’ of the countries and cultures with whom they do business. In order to better serve this growing trend, organizational psychologists, sociologists, and public administrators are researching the nature of cultural expression. According to a group of career counselors working with Susan Musich at Passport Career, individuals wanting to live and/or work abroad need to develop a self-awareness of their own means and methods of expression in order to be effective and productive members of multi-national environments. As such, they have identified the following categories of cultural articulation: expressive, reserved, and variable. Emotionally expressive cultures are described as ‘loud, open, and outgoing’. Emotionally reserved cultures are ‘quiet, pensive, and sometimes aloof.’ Variably expressive cultures share characteristics of both. Business strategies that work in one’s home country may be at odds with the professional practices of other cultures; thus, the growing need for professionals to recognize and acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of their individual styles of communication. Amos Rapoport, renowned architect, scholar, and founder of Environment-Behavior Studies, wrote that ‘architecture is a profession rooted in culture.’ He believes that the purpose of design is to not only produce user-oriented environments, but to predicate design on the knowledge of how people and environments interact. He further states that this interaction relies on an understanding of how to culturally organize and communicate space, time, and meaning. Societies are products of their culture, and architecture embodies the values of cultural inhabitation, construction, achievement, and design. Cultures are not static but over time specific aspects remain unchanged. As students become more aware of the relationship between culture and the built environment, they will better understand the ways in which their personal architectural philosophies either do, or do not, cross-culturally communicate, and the value they place on that understanding.',2,30, 'Summer','Arquitecture-Cross-Cultural-Communication-ang.pdf','Master','architecture'),
